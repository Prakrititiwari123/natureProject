      <h2>Section One</h2>
      <p>
        Nature is the ultimate source of our living. Both living and non-living things include nature, and everyone is interdependent, which helps maintain the ecosystem. Plants, animals, and humans all depend on nature for their survival. It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other necessary components.However, human activities like deforestation, pollution, and over-exploitation of natural resources are damaging nature. To protect nature, we should: 
        Reduce biological damage.Reuse and recycle materials.Avoid actions that contribute to global warming or ozone depletion.Conserve and balance natural resources.Nature provides us with several delicacies to enjoy and is our life support system. Our basic needs like food, shelter, water and air are all the gifts from nature. Humans have a strong connection and interrelation with nature. Escaping away in the nature heals the mind and body and soothes our soul.

      <p>
        For all of us, nature is crucial. It’s the reason for the existence of life on this planet. Nature is home to many different creatures. All living organisms benefit from the natural balance maintained by Mother Nature. The study of the natural environment is a separate discipline of science. Every element has its own story to tell. Nature’s beauty is portrayed through the sun and moon, the plants, the flowers, etc. It is a common belief that reacting to something is a natural human characteristic. Naturally drawn characteristics are defined as genetic traits of an organism in sociology. The resources of nature are plentiful. The proper use of resources aids in the conservation of the environment. Natural scavengers include a variety of land and marine animals. Nature has provided us with a variety of ways to utilise it effectively.Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to the planet’s beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find their habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy life.

      <h2>Section Three</h2>
      <p>
        With the increasing population, the threats towards nature are increasing. With the growth in population, the resources are now depleting. Excessive levels of air and environmental pollutants add to the mix. Industrial waste, unrestricted vehicle use, illicit tree cutting, wildlife hunting, nuclear power plants, and a slew of other factors are contributing to the disruption of natural systems. The extinction of species as enormous as dinosaurs and the survival of animals as tiny as ants have been documented in history. It is unavoidable to remember, among other things, that nature can play both a protective and destructive role. Natural disasters, pandemics, and natural crisis scenarios have demonstrated the need for humans to maintain the subtle balance of nature in order to ensure the continuation of life on Earth for the benefit of future generations.. But deforestation has been the primary cause of global warming, destroying nature. In addition to exploiting excessive natural resources, other industries pollute the environment with toxic gases and chemicals. It is now essential to reduce biological damage, reuse things, and recycle existing materials to create new ones. People from all over the world should join forces to relieve pressure on the environment and restore its balance. It is now the essential aim to serve nature with utmost care to save our nature from hazards and threats.
